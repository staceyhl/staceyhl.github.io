                    The piece responds to an incident that occurred when Shiota was nine-years old. She woke in the night to sound of burning timber and ran to wake her parents. The family then watched helplessly as a neighbourâ€™s home burned. Later, Shiota saw the remains of a piano charred and silent in the ashes.

                    There is a melancholic aura that hovers throughout the incinerated room filled with singed furniture. The miles of thread woven in, around, and through each item within the space adds a feeling of entrapment. The way it engulfs the room's furnishings encapsulates the destructive and overwhelming nature of flames that have possessed one's material properties.

                        "I became scared, and quickly ran home. There I tried to play on my piano. My mother said I should not play at a moment when the house of our neighbour had just been burnt down. But I felt as if my own voice had been burnt, too, and therefore continued to play. I was overcome by silence. Days later, the wind carried the smell of the extinguished fire over to us. I then felt every time I smelled it that the smoke made me lose my voice."

                        "This happened 20 years ago. I always carry this silence within me: deep in my heart. When I try to express it, I lack the necessary words. But the silence lasts. The more I think about it, the stronger it gets. The piano loses its voice, the painter does not paint any more, the musician stops making music. They lose their function, but not their beauty. They even become more beautiful."
