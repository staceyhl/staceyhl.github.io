        <h1>two pupusas and a burrito from la morenita</h1>
        <div class="desc">
            <p>
                La Morenita is located on the corner of your street and that street you turn left onto when you want to get to the highway. They make your favorite burrito in the world. You've never gotten pupusas from anywhere else. They make their own salsa. Perfect for when you feel too lazy to cook or have nothing in the fridge.

            <h2>ingredients</h2>

            <ul class="body-copy">
                <li>A happy but relaxing playlist. For example:
                    <li class="playlists"> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6CvBOuQq3fuu7uz0DsfINm?si=6f67f8245735489b" target="_blank">i'm almost 18 and i think i understand</a></li>
                    <li class="playlists"> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2WnDs1fxgOjth8HwUUDS97?si=bc119ea720ba4748" target="_blank">CYD</a></li>
                    <li class="playlists"> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58dgauHI4xoQv8FJG8FTJH?si=1cbefe2cdc644a67" target="_blank">classic</a></li>
                    <li class="playlists"> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1bvUQu20hmzyBhVdlQv5y8?si=518a08a790914598" target="_blank">can you taste the ice cream?</a></li>
                <li>A baseball cap stolen from your mom, ideally. But if you can't find one of hers, your dad or brother's hair sweat isn't that bad</li>
                <li>A chunky wallet shoved into the tiny pocket of your stupid girl pants</li>
                <li>Approximately $30</li>
                <li>Someone back at home clearing off the table and putting out plates and utensils and napkins</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>instructions</h2>

            <ol class="body-copy">
                <li>Put on enough clothes to go outside and not be arrested or uncomfortable</li>
                <li>Make sure you have your wallet, a baseball cap for the sun, your phone, and your headphones</li>
                <li>Put on sneakers you can easily slip on and off. The trip is short, it's not worth lacing up high top converse</li>
                <li>Choose a playlist that matches the weather. Do this before leaving, to avoid wasting half the travel time silently looking for music</li>
                <li>Tell the other person something indicating that you're leaving now. I usually go for "Okay, I'll be back"</li>
                <li>Start walking to the corner market</li>
                <li>Once you get there, enter through the side door. It'll lead you to where the food is immediately</li>
                <li>Ask for a chicken burrito because you're <span id="basic">basic</span> classic like that. Yes, you want everything in it. If they ask or you somehow muster up enough courage to speak up, ask for refried beans</li>
                <li>Ask again for two pupusas. If you've gotten there early enough in the afternoon, they won't be sold out yet</li>
                <li>Also ask for a "large thing" of rice. You won't eat all of it today, but it's one of the best foods in the world so you'll want the leftovers for later that night when you're hungry again</li>
                <li>Wait awkwardly on your phone for the food. When it's ready, make sure the cabbage for the pupusas is there</li>
                <li>Grab a tub of the salsa they sell. It's on display above the glass case where all the meat is. The brown one</li>
                <li>Hold your breath as you walk past the meat</li>
                <li>Get a Jarritos for yourself and a bottled Coke for the other person</li>
                <li>Get a little treat for yourself. Gum, Mentos, one of those push up candies that has that spicy-sweet gel candy stuff</li>
                <li>Smile at the cashier when you pay. You don't know her name, but you recognize her from all the years she's worked there</li>
                <li>Trek back. Realize you probably should've taken the car because all the food you got is heavy</li>
                <li>Dump the food on the table. Keep your treat hidden in your pocket so nobody else can take some</li>
                <li>Plate, use a bottle opener to open your Jarritos even though it's a twist off, and start eating</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>the perfect bite</h2>

            <h3>Burrito:</h3>
                <ul class="body-copy">
                    <li>A little bit on the tinfoil wrapping</li>
                    <li>Some salsa poured only onto the bite you're taking</li>
                    <li>Followed by a sip of Coke</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Pupusa:</h3>
                <ul class="body-copy">
                    <li>A bite sized portion ripped off with your hands</li>
                    <li>Some salsa poured on top just like the burrito</li>
                    <li>Some cabbage stabbed onto the fork, which then stabs into the pupusa</li>
                    <li>As soon as that is in your mouth, shovel some rice in there as well. The amount of rice you want won't fit on the fork, so this way is easier</li>
                    <li>As you're chewing, adjust levels of rice/salsa/cabbage as needed</li>
                    <li>Followed by a sip of Jarritos</li>
                </ul>
