                Based upon experience with hundreds of adults, adolescents, and children with OCD treated at our clinic, we argue that a substantial number of OCD patients pre<em>sent for treatment w</em>ith an identifiable variant of OCD – more precisely an OCD/TD blend. This blend is distinguishable from “purer” manifestations of either disorder and can be identified exclusively by phenomenological presentation. These patients or their first- degree family members may or may not have met criteria for TD or another tic disorder and may or may not have classic OCD symptoms, y<em>et it is our</em> position that their presentation is phenomenologically akin to both TD and OCD. Moreover, we believe that these patients express a cons<em>tellation</em> of symptoms (i.e., a syndrome) that is categorically distinct from more familiar forms of OCD, although this syndrome may coexist with OCD symptoms in many individuals. We refer to this syndrome as “Tourettic OCD” (TOCD) to underscore our view that these clinical manifestations are best understood and treated as a hybrid with features associated with the two disorders, as described in detail below. “Tourettic OCD” was chosen: a) to em<em>phasize the fact that many of thes</em>e patients exhibit symptoms closely resembling those found in the later developmental manifestations of TD in which OC symptoms and complex tics are said to coexist (Bruun, 1988); b) to de-emphasize a personal or family history of tics, thus including individuals who never displayed clearly discernable motor or phonic tics; and c) to promote this conceptual tool for the clinicians who are most likely to encounter patients with these characteristics, namely those working within the OCD realm. The “Tourett<em>ic OCD” term will help</em> remind clinicians to address the Tourettic features of the clinical presentation. The new term also has the advantage of being clearly distinguishable from “tic-related OCD” and “intentional repetitive behavior,” terms that focus more on the presence and nature of particular behaviors rather than on broader pathological processes involved (i.e. repetitive behaviors of types commonly associated with OCD but driven largely by <em>experiences of sensory discom</em>fort typically associated with TD). Finally, the TOCD term may also promote greater interest in research on the OCD/TD interface, an arena that has had only minimal impact on standard clinical practice.
