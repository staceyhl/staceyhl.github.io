        <h1>Tics or Tourette's?</h1>

        <div id="intro">
            <p>
                Tics are sudden t<em>witches, movemen</em>ts, or sounds that people do repeatedly. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things. For example, a person with a motor tic might keep blinking over and over again. Or, a person with a vocal tic might make a grunting sound unwillingly.

                <br><br>The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 is used by health professionals to help diagnose tic disorders.

                <br><br>Three tic disorders are included in the DSM-5:

                <ul>
                    <li>Tourette’s disorder (also called Tourette Syndrome [TS])</li>
                    <li>Persistent (also called <em>chronic) m</em>otor or vocal tic disorder</li>
                    <li>Provisional tic disorder</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="subh-1">Tourette <em>Syndrome</em> (TS)</h2>

        <div id="text-1">
            <p>
                To be diagnosed with TS, a person must:

                <ul>
                    <li>have two or more motor tics (for example, blinking or shrugging the shoulders) and at least o<em>ne vocal tic (fo</em>r example, humming, clearing the throat, or yelling out a word or phrase), although they might not always happen at the same time.</li>
                    <li>have had tics for at least a year. The tics can occur many times a day (usually in bouts) nearly every day, or off and on.</li>
                    <li>have tics that be<em>gin</em> before age 18 years.</li>
                    <li>have symptoms that are not due to taking medicine or other drugs or due to having another medical condition (for example, seizures, Huntington disease, or postviral encephalitis).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Persistent (Chronic) <em>Motor o</em>r Vocal Tic Disorder</h2>

                    <li>have tics that occur many times a day nearly every day or on and off throughout a period of more than a year.</li>
                    <li>have tics that start before age 18 years.</li>
                    <li>have symptoms that are not due to taking medicine or other drugs, or due to having a medical <em>condition that c</em>an cause tics (for example, seizures, Huntington disease, or postviral encephalitis).</li>
