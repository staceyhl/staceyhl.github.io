        <h1>What About This?</h1>

        <div>
            <p>
                Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder presents itself in many guises, and certainly goes far beyond the common misconception that OCD is merely a little hand washing or checking light switches. Although those are valid OCD compulsions, such perceptions fail to acknowledge the  distressing thoughts that occur prior to such behaviours and also fails to highlight the utter devastation that constant compulsions (no matter what they are) can cause. Although there are infinite forms of OCD, it has been traditionally considered that a person’s OCD will fall into one of these five main categories, with themes often overlapping between categories too.

                <ul>
                    <li>Checking</li>
                    <li>Contamination / Mental Contamination</li>
                    <li>Symmetry and ordering</li>
                    <li>Ruminations / Intrusive Thoughts</li>
                    <li>Hoarding</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Symmetry and Orderliness</h2>

            <p>
                The need to have everything lined up symmetrically just ‘right’ is the compulsion, the obsessive fear might be to ensure everything feels ‘just right’ to prevent discomfort or sometimes to prevent harm occurring (see Magical Thinking). Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Neatness</li>
                    <li>Pictures</li>
                    <li>Tinned Cans</li>
                    <li>Clothes</li>
                    <li>Books and CD's</li>
                    <li>Spotless without blemish</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Those affected will spend a lot of time trying to get the symmetry ‘just right’ and this time consuming checking can result in them being extremely late for work and appointments. They may also become mentally and physically drained if the compulsions take a considerable amount of time. The sufferer may also avoid social contact at home to prevent the symmetry and order being disrupted which can have a negative impact on social interaction and relationships.
