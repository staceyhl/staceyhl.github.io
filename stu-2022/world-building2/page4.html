                “Not just right” OCD  is a category of OCD where individuals often experience an overpowering internal sense that the balance, order, place, frequency or position of something is disturbed and must be corrected. It can be a spoken or written word, touch, feel, sound, or smell of something that is not ‘just right.’

            <p id="two">
                The individual with ‘just right’ OCD often performs endless repetitions of ordinary tasks out of frustration that they are not ‘perfect’ or ‘just right.’ Touching and tapping, symmetry, ordering, and arranging, perfectionism and counting can all be part of the rituals related to ‘just right’ OCD.

                For some individuals with NJR OCD, the feeling is not accompanied with any specific fear but rather difficulty tolerating feelings of discomfort/tension that are associated with skipping rituals. For these individuals, exposures may look more similar to habit reversal training with emphasis on the practice of tolerating difficult sensations.

                With just right OCD, people want to “shake off” the feeling and some describe it as a “tip of the tongue” experience that could be resolved in any second. In just right OCD, extraordinary effort is put into making the “just right” obsession go away, which is similar to other OCD subtypes.
