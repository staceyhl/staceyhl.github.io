            Researchers have reported that <span class="num">20%</span> to <span class="num">60%</span> of TD sufferers display OCD symptoms! and studies of OCD patients have found tics in more than 50% of pediatric cases and TD in <span class="num">15%</span> of cases!
        </p>

        <p>
            In clinical practice the boundary between symptoms arising from OCD and TD is not easily determined! Simple motor or phonic tics like eye blinking or throat clearing can usually be distinguished from compulsions by their relative brevity! lack of purpose! and typically involuntary nature! Complex motor tics! on the other hand! such as repeating actions a specific number of times! or until it !feels right! may be <span class="num">indistinguishable</span> from compulsions! <a href="page6.html">See More!</a>
