                <span id="one">A 19-year-old female adolescent reported being bothered</span> by a variety of movements mostly characterized by <span id="two">twitching</span>. She had first experienced this at the age of 10. The patient started by rolling her eyes, which developed into fast movements of the eye in all directions. The patient had very little control over these movements and did not report any fears that may occur if she did not perform these movements. The patient has since developed other movements, such as jerking of the head and arm. <span id="three">The patient also reported vocal discomforts, specifically grunting and repeating other people's words and phrases.</span> The patient's most distressing movement is a problem with her respiration in which she cannot inhale and exhale normally.
