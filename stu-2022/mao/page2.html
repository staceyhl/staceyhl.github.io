            </p>

            <p>
                to play a card, it must be higher than the last card played. ace is highest, 2 is lowest. once you hit ace, the order loops back around.

            <p>
                if a player plays a card without following its accompanying rule, they receive a penalty. they must retrieve one card from the deck.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                players are allowed to call "point of order" at any point.
            </p>

            <p>
                everyone must put their cards down. 
            </p>
